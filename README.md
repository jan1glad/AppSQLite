# AppSQLite
App with SQLite.
On starting page first you need click on "Admin" button to insert first row that will let you log in to "Menu". 
After that you should add some values by clicking "Insert" button.
Than you are ready to go and operate on "Select, Update, Delete". 
This is my first application in Android Studio, so it is a bit raw but I wanted to know how start with it. 
Probably next project will be "SearchFlight" that I made using servlets but now I wll do it in Android Studio.
